## Introduction ##

**What are the minimum system requirements to be able to run Pentoo Penetration Testing Overlay and Livecd effectively?**

Pretty much just having a computer will let you run Pentoo. lol. But seriously, it depends on what you want to do. Pentoo Penetration Testing Overlay is supported on i686, amd64, and ARM (both armel and armhf) platforms.

**Prerequisites and System Requirements for running Pentoo livecd**

  * Live Environment - No 3D Desktop:
    * i686 Processor
    * at least 1 GiB of RAM (2 GiB suggested)
    * a 2D graphics card
    * a DDC capable Monitor
    * mouse and keyboard

  * Live Environment - 3D Desktop:
    * i686 Processor (starting from AMD K6 and Intel Pentium II)
    * at least 2 GiB of RAM (4 GiB suggested)
    * an OpenGL capable 3D graphics card (mostly NVIDIA, ATI, Intel, VIA)
    * a DDC capable Monitor
    * mouse and keyboard

  * Installation:
    * i686 Processor
    * at least 2 GiB of RAM
    * an OpenGL capable 3D graphics card (mostly NVIDIA, ATI, Intel, VIA)
    * 20 GiB of free space, that is bare minimum DVD Install. 30+ GiB is highly recommended.
    * Internet connection (not mandatory but highly suggested)
    * a DDC capable Monitor
    * mouse and keyboard

**Prerequisites and System Requirements for running with Pentoo overlay**

  * Overlay:
    * i686 or ARM Processor
    * at least 512 MiB of RAM (2 GiB suggested)
    * an OpenGL capable 3D graphics card (mostly NVIDIA, ATI, Intel, VIA)
    * 20 GiB of free space, 30+ GiB is highly  recommended.
    * Internet connection (not mandatory but highly suggested)
    * a DDC capable Monitor
    * mouse and keyboard

**Pentoo Penetration Testing Overlay and Livecd** can be as heavy as you want, or as small as you want. Yet unless you deviate from the documented approach, Gentoo Linux remains a source-based distribution.

Because of that, it has a slightly higher disk space requirement than other distributions.
To have a comfortable installation, yet with room to spare for additional installations, you should consider a total diskspace of at least 20 Gbyte for the applications alone. With current disk sizes, this should not be a problem. If you don't install a full-blown KDE or GNOME, you should have enough with 20Gbyte.

Disk space aside, Gentoo Linux can run and install with almost any system specification. Of course, the lower the specs, the higher the duration of an installation.
